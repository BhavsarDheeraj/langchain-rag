       " Document(page_content='‚ö° Building language agents as graphs ‚ö°Overview\\u200bLangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of (and intended to be used with) LangChain.\\nIt extends the LangChain Expression Language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner.\\nIt is inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam.\\nThe current interface exposed is one inspired by NetworkX.The main use is for adding cycles to your LLM application.\\nCrucially, LangGraph is NOT optimized for only DAG workflows.\\nIf you want to build a DAG, you should just use LangChain Expression Language.Cycles are important for agent-like behaviors, where you call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.Installation\\u200bpip install langgraphQuick start\\u200bOne of the central concepts of LangGraph is state. Each graph execution creates a state that is passed between nodes in the graph as they execute, and each node updates this internal state with its return value after it executes. The way that the graph updates its internal state is defined by either the type of graph chosen or a custom function.State in LangGraph can be pretty general, but to keep things simpler to start, we\\'ll show off an example where the graph\\'s state is limited to a list of chat messages using the built-in MessageGraph class. This is convenient when using LangGraph with LangChain chat models because we can return chat model output directly.First, install the LangChain OpenAI integration package:pip install langchain_openaiWe also need to export some environment variables:export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...And now we\\'re ready! The graph below contains a single node called \"oracle\" that executes a chat model, then returns the result:from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessagefrom langgraph.graph import END, MessageGraphmodel = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)graph = MessageGraph()graph.add_node(\"oracle\", model)graph.add_edge(\"oracle\", END)graph.set_entry_point(\"oracle\")runnable = graph.compile()Let\\'s run it!runnable.invoke(HumanMessage(\"What is 1 + 1?\"))[HumanMessage(content=\\'What is 1 + 1?\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'1 + 1 equals 2.\\')]So what did we do here? Let\\'s break it down step by step:First, we initialize our model and a MessageGraph.Next, we add a single node to the graph, called \"oracle\", which simply calls the model with the given input.We add an edge from this \"oracle\" node to the special string END. This means that execution will end after current node.We set \"oracle\" as the entrypoint to the graph.We compile the graph, ensuring that no more modifications to it can be made.Then, when we execute the graph:LangGraph adds the input message to the internal state, then passes the state to the entrypoint node, \"oracle\".The \"oracle\" node executes, invoking the chat model.The chat model returns an AIMessage. LangGraph adds this to the state.Execution progresses to the special END value and outputs the final state.And as a result, we get a list of two chat messages as output.Interaction with LCEL\\u200bAs an aside for those already familiar with LangChain - add_node actually takes any function or runnable as input. In the above example, the model is used \"as-is\", but we could also have passed in a function:def call_oracle(messages: list):    return model.invoke(message)graph.add_node(\"oracle\", call_oracle)Just make sure you are mindful of the fact that the input to the runnable is the entire current state. So this will fail:# This will not work with MessageGraph!from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholderprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant named {name} who always speaks in pirate dialect\"),    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"messages\"),])chain = prompt | model# State is a list of messages, but our chain expects a dict input:## { \"name\": some_string, \"messages\": [] }## Therefore, the graph will throw an exception when it executes here.graph.add_node(\"oracle\", chain)Conditional edges\\u200bNow, let\\'s move onto something a little bit less trivial. Because math can be difficult for LLMs, let\\'s allow the LLM to conditionally call a \"multiply\" node using tool calling.We\\'ll recreate our graph with an additional \"multiply\" that will take the result of the most recent message, if it is a tool call, and calculate the result.\\nWe\\'ll also bind the calculator to the OpenAI model as a tool to allow the model to optionally use the tool necessary to respond to the current state:import jsonfrom langchain_core.messages import ToolMessagefrom langchain_core.tools import toolfrom langchain_core.utils.function_calling import convert_to_openai_tool@tooldef multiply(first_number: int, second_number: int):    \"\"\"Multiplies two numbers together.\"\"\"    return first_number * second_numbermodel = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)model_with_tools = model.bind(tools=[convert_to_openai_tool(multiply)])graph = MessageGraph()def invoke_model(state: List[BaseMessage]):    return model_with_tools.invoke(state)graph.add_node(\"oracle\", invoke_model)def invoke_tool(state: List[BaseMessage]):    tool_calls = state[-1].additional_kwargs.get(\"tool_calls\", [])    multiply_call = None    for tool_call in tool_calls:        if tool_call.get(\"function\").get(\"name\") == \"multiply\":            multiply_call = tool_call    if multiply_call is None:        raise Exception(\"No adder input found.\")    res = multiply.invoke(        json.loads(multiply_call.get(\"function\").get(\"arguments\"))    )    return ToolMessage(        tool_call_id=multiply_call.get(\"id\"),        content=res    )graph.add_node(\"multiply\", invoke_tool)graph.add_edge(\"multiply\", END)graph.set_entry_point(\"oracle\")Now let\\'s think - what do we want to have happen?If the \"oracle\" node returns a message expecting a tool call, we want to execute the \"multiply\" nodeIf not, we can just end executionWe can achieve this using conditional edges, which routes execution to a node based on the current state using a function.Here\\'s what that looks like:def router(state: List[BaseMessage]):    tool_calls = state[-1].additional_kwargs.get(\"tool_calls\", [])    if len(tool_calls):        return \"multiply\"    else:        return \"end\"graph.add_conditional_edges(\"oracle\", router, {    \"multiply\": \"multiply\",    \"end\": END,})If the model output contains a tool call, we move to the \"multiply\" node. Otherwise, we end.Great! Now all that\\'s left is to compile the graph and try it out. Math-related questions are routed to the calculator tool:runnable = graph.compile()runnable.invoke(HumanMessage(\"What is 123 * 456?\"))[HumanMessage(content=\\'What is 123 * 456?\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'\\', additional_kwargs={\\'tool_calls\\': [{\\'id\\': \\'call_OPbdlm8Ih1mNOObGf3tMcNgb\\', \\'function\\': {\\'arguments\\': \\'{\"first_number\":123,\"second_number\":456}\\', \\'name\\': \\'multiply\\'}, \\'type\\': \\'function\\'}]}), ToolMessage(content=\\'56088\\', tool_call_id=\\'call_OPbdlm8Ih1mNOObGf3tMcNgb\\')]While conversational responses are outputted directly:runnable.invoke(HumanMessage(\"What is your name?\"))[HumanMessage(content=\\'What is your name?\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'My name is Assistant. How can I assist you today?\\')]Cycles\\u200bNow, let\\'s go over a more general example with a cycle. We will recreate the AgentExecutor class from LangChain. The agent itself will use chat models and function calling.\\nThis agent will represent all its state as a list of messages.We will need to install some LangChain packages, as well as Tavily to use as an example tool.pip install -U langchain langchain_openai tavily-pythonWe also need to export some additional environment variables for OpenAI and Tavily API access.export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...export TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...Optionally, we can set up LangSmith for best-in-class observability.export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=ls__...Set up the tools\\u200bAs above, we will first define the tools we want to use.\\nFor this simple example, we will use a built-in search tool via Tavily.\\nHowever, it is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation here on how to do that.from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResultstools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]We can now wrap these tools in a simple LangGraph ToolExecutor.\\nThis class receives ToolInvocation objects, calls that tool, and returns the output.\\nToolInvocation is any class with tool and tool_input attributes.from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolExecutortool_executor = ToolExecutor(tools)Set up the model\\u200bNow we need to load the chat model we want to use.\\nThis time, we\\'ll use the older function calling interface. This walkthrough will use OpenAI, but we can choose any model that supports OpenAI function calling.from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI# We will set streaming=True so that we can stream tokens# See the streaming section for more information on this.model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, streaming=True)After we\\'ve done this, we should make sure the model knows that it has these tools available to call.\\nWe can do this by converting the LangChain tools into the format for OpenAI function calling, and then bind them to the model class.from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_functionfunctions = [format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]model = model.bind_functions(functions)Define the agent state\\u200bThis time, we\\'ll use the more general StateGraph.\\nThis graph is parameterized by a state object that it passes around to each node.\\nRemember that each node then returns operations to update that state.\\nThese operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute.\\nWhether to set or add is denoted by annotating the state object you construct the graph with.For this example, the state we will track will just be a list of messages.\\nWe want each node to just add messages to that list.\\nTherefore, we will use a TypedDict with one key (messages) and annotate it so that the messages attribute is always added to with the second parameter (operator.add).from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Sequenceimport operatorfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessageclass AgentState(TypedDict):    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]You can think of the MessageGraph used in the initial example as a preconfigured version of this graph, where the state is directly an array of messages,\\nand the update step is always to append the returned values of a node to the internal state.Define the nodes\\u200bWe now need to define a few different nodes in our graph.\\nIn langgraph, a node can be either a function or a runnable.\\nThere are two main nodes we need for this:The agent: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.A function to invoke tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.We will also need to define some edges.\\nSome of these edges may be conditional.\\nThe reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken.\\nThe path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).Conditional Edge: after the agent is called, we should either:a. If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools should be calledb. If the agent said that it was finished, then it should finishNormal Edge: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do nextLet\\'s define the nodes, as well as a function to decide how what conditional edge to take.from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolInvocationimport jsonfrom langchain_core.messages import FunctionMessage# Define the function that determines whether to continue or notdef should_continue(state):    messages = state[\\'messages\\']    last_message = messages[-1]    # If there is no function call, then we finish    if \"function_call\" not in last_message.additional_kwargs:        return \"end\"    # Otherwise if there is, we continue    else:        return \"continue\"# Define the function that calls the modeldef call_model(state):    messages = state[\\'messages\\']    response = model.invoke(messages)    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list    return {\"messages\": [response]}# Define the function to execute toolsdef call_tool(state):    messages = state[\\'messages\\']    # Based on the continue condition    # we know the last message involves a function call    last_message = messages[-1]    # We construct an ToolInvocation from the function_call    action = ToolInvocation(        tool=last_message.additional_kwargs[\"function_call\"][\"name\"],        tool_input=json.loads(last_message.additional_kwargs[\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"]),    )    # We call the tool_executor and get back a response    response = tool_executor.invoke(action)    # We use the response to create a FunctionMessage    function_message = FunctionMessage(content=str(response), name=action.tool)    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list    return {\"messages\": [function_message]}Define the graph\\u200bWe can now put it all together and define the graph!from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END# Define a new graphworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)# Define the two nodes we will cycle betweenworkflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)workflow.add_node(\"action\", call_tool)# Set the entrypoint as `agent`# This means that this node is the first one calledworkflow.set_entry_point(\"agent\")# We now add a conditional edgeworkflow.add_conditional_edges(    # First, we define the start node.

In order to make it easier to understand what is happening under the hood, we\\'ve added methods to print out and visualize the graph.\\nThis can create both ascii art as well as pngs.\\nFor a walkthrough on how to do that, see this documentation\"Time Travel\"\\u200bWith \"time travel\" functionality you can jump to any point in the graph execution, modify the state, and rerun from there.\\nThis is useful for both debugging workflows, as well as end user-facing workflows to allow them to correct the state.\\nFor a walkthrough on how to do that, see this documentationExamples\\u200bChatAgentExecutor: with function calling\\u200bThis agent executor takes a list of messages as input and outputs a list of messages.\\nAll agent state is represented as a list of messages.\\nThis specifically uses OpenAI function calling.\\nThis is recommended agent executor for newer chat based models that support function calling.Getting Started Notebook: Walks through creating this type of executor from scratchHigh Level Entrypoint: Walks through how to use the high level entrypoint for the chat agent executor.ModificationsWe also have a lot of examples highlighting how to slightly modify the base chat agent executor.

Based on the Plan-and-solve paper by Wang, et. al.Reasoning without Observation: planner generates a task list whose observations are saved as variables. Variables can be used in subsequent tasks to reduce the need for further re-planning. Based on the ReWOO paper by Xu, et. al.LLMCompiler: planner generates a DAG of tasks with variable responses. Tasks are streamed and executed eagerly to minimize tool execution runtime. Based on the paper by Kim, et. al.Reflection / Self-Critique\\u200bWhen output quality is a major concern, it\\'s common to incorporate some combination of self-critique or reflection and external validation to refine your system\\'s outputs. The following examples demonstrate research that implement this type of design.Basic Reflection: add a simple \"reflect\" step in your graph to prompt your system to revise its outputs.Reflexion: critique missing and superflous aspects of the agent\\'s response to guide subsequent steps. Based on Reflexion, by Shinn, et. al.Language Agent Tree Search: execute multiple agents in parallel, using reflection and environmental rewards to drive a Monte Carlo Tree Search. Based on LATS, by Zhou, et. al.Multi-agent Examples\\u200bMulti-agent collaboration: how to create two agents that work together to accomplish a taskMulti-agent with supervisor: how to orchestrate individual agents by using an LLM as a \"supervisor\" to distribute workHierarchical agent teams: how to orchestrate \"teams\" of agents as nested graphs that can collaborate to solve a problemWeb Research\\u200bSTORM: writing system that generates Wikipedia-style articles on any topic, applying outline generation (planning) + multi-perspective question-answering for added breadth and reliability. Based on STORM by Shao, et. al.Chatbot Evaluation via Simulation\\u200bIt can often be tough to evaluation chat bots in multi-turn situations. One way to do this is with simulations.Chat bot evaluation as multi-agent simulation: how to simulate a dialogue between a \"virtual user\" and your chat botEvaluating over a dataset: benchmark your assistant over a LangSmith dataset, which tasks a simulated customer to red-team your chat bot.Multimodal Examples\\u200bWebVoyager: vision-enabled web browsing agent that uses Set-of-marks prompting to navigate a web browser and execute tasksChain-of-Table\\u200bChain of Table is a framework that elicits SOTA performance when answering questions over tabular data. This implementation by Github user CYQIQ uses LangGraph to control the flow.Documentation\\u200bThere are only a few new APIs to use.StateGraph\\u200bThe main entrypoint is StateGraph.from langgraph.graph import StateGraphThis class is responsible for constructing the graph.\\nIt exposes an interface inspired by NetworkX.\\nThis graph is parameterized by a state object that it passes around to each node.__init__\\u200b    def __init__(self, schema: Type[Any]) -> None:When constructing the graph, you need to pass in a schema for a state.\\nEach node then returns operations to update that state.\\nThese operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute.\\nWhether to set or add is denoted by annotating the state object you construct the graph with.The recommended way to specify the schema is with a typed dictionary: from typing import TypedDictYou can then annotate the different attributes using from typing import Annotated.\\nCurrently, the only supported annotation is import operator; operator.add.\\nThis annotation will make it so that any node that returns this attribute ADDS that new result to the existing value.Let\\'s take a look at an example:from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Unionfrom langchain_core.agents import AgentAction, AgentFinishimport operatorclass AgentState(TypedDict):   # The input string   input: str   # The outcome of a given call to the agent   # Needs `None` as a valid type, since this is what this will start as   agent_outcome: Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish, None]   # List of actions and corresponding observations   # Here we annotate this with `operator.add` to indicate that operations to   # this state should be ADDED to the existing values (not overwrite it)   intermediate_steps: Annotated[list[tuple[AgentAction, str]], operator.add]We can then use this like:# Initialize the StateGraph with this stategraph = StateGraph(AgentState)# Create nodes and edges...# Compile the graphapp = graph.compile()# The inputs should be a dictionary, because the state is a TypedDictinputs = {   # Let\\'s assume this the input   \"input\": \"hi\"   # Let\\'s assume agent_outcome is set by the graph as some point   # It doesn\\'t need to be provided, and it will be None by default   # Let\\'s assume `intermediate_steps` is built up over time by the graph   # It doesn\\'t need to provided, and it will be empty list by default   # The reason `intermediate_steps` is an empty list and not `None` is because   # it\\'s annotated with `operator.add`}.add_node\\u200b    def add_node(self, key: str, action: RunnableLike) -> None:This method adds a node to the graph.\\nIt takes two arguments:key: A string representing the name of the node. This must be unique.action: The action to take when this node is called. This should either be a function or a runnable..add_edge\\u200b    def add_edge(self, start_key: str, end_key: str) -> None:Creates an edge from one node to the next.\\nThis means that output of the first node will be passed to the next node.\\nIt takes two arguments.start_key: A string representing the name of the start node.

This key must have already been registered in the graph.condition: A function to call to decide what to do next. The input will be the output of the start node. It should return a string that is present in conditional_edge_mapping and represents the edge to take.conditional_edge_mapping: A mapping of string to string. The keys should be strings that may be returned by condition. The values should be the downstream node to call if that condition is returned..set_entry_point\\u200b    def set_entry_point(self, key: str) -> None:The entrypoint to the graph.\\nThis is the node that is first called.\\nIt only takes one argument:key: The name of the node that should be called first..set_conditional_entry_point\\u200b    def set_conditional_entry_point(        self,        condition: Callable[..., str],        conditional_edge_mapping: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,    ) -> None:This method adds a conditional entry point.\\nWhat this means is that when the graph is called, it will call the condition Callable to decide what node to enter into first.condition: A function to call to decide what to do next. The input will be the input to the graph. It should return a string that is present in conditional_edge_mapping and represents the edge to take.conditional_edge_mapping: A mapping of string to string.
